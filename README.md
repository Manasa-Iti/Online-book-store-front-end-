# Onlline-book-store-front-end-
This project is about an online book store system, where initially we would open the registration form page, where we need to enter all the valued information. and then on clicking submit it would lead us to the login page. On the login page, we need to give the correct email id and password. If the wrong format of email id or password is written then a validation popup would appear. By giving the details on the login page and on clicking login we are taken to the purchase page. Finally, on the purchase page, we can select the book desired, and then we can submit the form.
